# RL-Leiden-S24: Reinforcement Learning Assignment 2
## Goal: Training Deep Q-learning Network on Cart Pole environment

## File structure:
*Agent.py* contains the DQNLearningAgent.

*DQN_learner.py* contains the 

*Experiment.py* contains the functions for running varying learners for varying parameters, collecting the results.

*Helper.py* contains useful functions for use throughout the other files.

*Neural_network.py* contains the DeepNeuralNetwork class. Runs the fully connected convolutional network.
